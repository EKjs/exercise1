        <h2>What is photography</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating
            durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of
            an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
            material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of
            science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as
            well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production,
            recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. Typically, a
            lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects
            into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
            during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this
            produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically
            processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display
            or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible
            latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible
            image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the
            photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image
            on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive
            image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger
            or by contact printing.

        <h2>My services</h2>
        <article class="services">
          <h3>1. Portrait Photography</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or
            portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an
            individual or group. Images may be candid or posed, full body or
            close-ups. Either way, the subjectâ€™s face and eyes are typically in
            focus. Lighting and backdrop help to convey tone and emotion.
            Popular types of photography portraits include senior portraits,
            family portraits, engagement photos, and professional headshots. The
            best portrait photographers make clients feel completely
            comfortable, so that their expressions are natural and relaxed.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Photojournalism</h3>
          <p>
            Photojournalism is a way of telling the story of a newsworthy
            (perhaps even historic) event or scene through photographs.
            Photojournalism should be as objective and truthful as possible and
            capturing candid moments as they happen is more important than
            getting picture-perfect shots. Generally, photojournalists attend
            planned events with the hope of capturing unplanned, unscripted
            moments. Their work is routinely published in magazines and
            newspapers.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Fashion Photography</h3>
          <p>
            Fashion photography showcases and glamorizes fashion clothing,
            shoes, and accessories to make them more desirable to consumers. It
            is commonly published in magazines and online. People may choose
            this niche over different types of photography because of the
            opportunity to be highly creative in making photographs eye-catching
            and appealing. Fashion photographers take a lot of full body shots
            and work in an array of locations, from fashion shows to studios
            with full lighting setups to city streets and open fields. They
            utilize many of the same skills as portrait photographers and must
            practice good teamwork and communication when working with shoot
            stylists, creative directors, and models.

        <article>
          <p>
            Wedding photography is a specialty in photography that is primarily
            focused on the photography of events and activities relating to
            weddings. It may include other types of portrait photography of the
            couple before the official wedding day, such as a pre-wedding
            engagement session (photographs are later used for the couple
            wedding invitations).
